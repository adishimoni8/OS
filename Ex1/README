FILES:
myfile.c -- a file with some code
myfile.h -- a file with some headers

REMARKS:
These are some remarks that
I want the graders to know
about this submission.

ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
WhatIDo is a given program which expects a single argument and for it to be
a file descriptor.

In case there is no supplied argument to the program,
upon running the program, it checks whether the desired argument
is given or not.
It attempts to duplicate the non given input as a file descriptor and checks
it's existence and validity.
Once it figures that there is no given argument, it prints an error message to
stderr, afterwards it prints "Success", closes the duplicated file descriptor
and exits with exit code SUCCESS(0).

In case there is a supplied argument, the program creates a directory
named "Welcome" and inside of it, creates another directory named "To".
Both directories are defined to own the same permissions:
For user and group: read, write and execute permissions.
For other: only read and execute.
It then creates a new file named "OS2021" inside "To" directory with read and
write permissions.
Afterwards, it writes into "OS2021" the following:
"(user name), If you haven't read the course guidelines yet ---
do it right now!".
Eventually, it closes the file, deletes it, deletes "To" directory and lastly,
deletes the 'Welcome' directory and exits the program with exit code SUCCESS(0).

Q2:
Here are answers to theoreical questions
if there were such questions in the exercise.
